Hi, nice to e-meet you! My name is Edwin Lim and I am currently a first-year Electrical and Computer Engineering PhD student working with [James Hoe](https://users.ece.cmu.edu/~jhoe/doku/doku.php) and [Akshitha Sriraman](https://users.ece.cmu.edu/~asrirama/) at Carnegie Mellon University. My research interests lie at the **intersection of computer systems and hardware, with a focus on making modern Machine Learning (ML) applications more efficient and sustainable.** Specifically, my most recent research evaluates the potential of second-life GPUs and geographically distributed workload scheduling for more sustainable ML inference.

I completed my undergraduate studies in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at UC Berkeley (Class of 2023), where I was fortunate to work with [Sagar Karandikar](https://sagark.org/) and [Krste AsanoviÄ‡](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~krste/) on computer architecture research within the [SLICE Lab](https://slice.eecs.berkeley.edu/). Here, **I focused on enabling [multi-FPGA accelerated simulation of large-scale RTL designs](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~ysshao/assets/papers/ISCA2024-FireAxe.pdf) and building [hardware (de)compression accelerators for hyperscale SoCs](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3579371.3589074).**

Currently, I am on leave from my PhD to work at... [TBD]

The best way to reach me is through email at **eglim [at] andrew [dot] cmu [dot] edu.**

Technical Interests
======
In general, **I love working at the intersection of hardware and software to make things run quickly, efficiently, and scalably.** In the distant past, I was primarily rooted in computer architecture, until I realized I have to write code in order for the chips I build to be useful (haha). The following topics, in particular, excite me greatly. The intersection of these fields is where I prefer to work.
- Computer architecture and systems
- Machine learning
- Sustainable computing
- Hyperscale systems

Non-Technical Interests
======
I'm a very active person, and am in the process of figuring out the whole "work-life-balance" thing. Having a life outside of work is critical to my sanity, but it's easier said than done! Although I try not to fall into "Tech Bro" stereotypes, sometimes it is unavoidable. At least I do not currently own any Patagonia clothing (as of August 2024). Some of the things I do in my free time are:
- Rock climbing (I like bouldering)
- Weightlifting
- Hiking
- Biking
- Cello
- Super Smash Bros. Ultimate (I main Fox)
- Eating Korean/Indian/Japanese/Chinese/Mexican/Italian/Thai/Greek food (I'm not a fan of fusion though)
