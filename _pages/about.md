Hi, nice to e-meet you! My name is Edwin Lim and I am currently a first-year Electrical and Computer Engineering PhD student working with [James Hoe](https://users.ece.cmu.edu/~jhoe/doku/doku.php) and [Akshitha Sriraman](https://users.ece.cmu.edu/~asrirama/) at CMU. My research interests lie at the intersection of computer systems and hardware, with a focus on making modern Machine Learning (ML) applications more efficient and sustainable. Specifically, my most recent research evaluates the potential of second-life GPUs and geographically distributed workload scheduling for more sustainable ML inference.

I completed my undergraduate studies in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at UC Berkeley (Class of 2023), where I was fortunate to work with [Sagar Karandikar](https://sagark.org/) and [Krste AsanoviÄ‡](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~krste/) on computer architecture research within the [SLICE Lab](https://slice.eecs.berkeley.edu/). Here, I focused on enabling [multi-FPGA accelerated simulation of large-scale RTL designs](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~ysshao/assets/papers/ISCA2024-FireAxe.pdf) and building [hardware (de)compression accelerators for hyperscale SoCs](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3579371.3589074).

In general, I love working at the intersection of hardware and software to make things run fast and efficiently.

Currently, I am on leave from my PhD to work at... (TBD)

The best way to reach me is through email at eglim [at] andrew [dot] cmu [dot] edu.
