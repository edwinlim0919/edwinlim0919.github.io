A gentle introduction to my teaching experiences at UC Berkeley.

---

At the time, we were still deep in the throes of the COVID-19 pandemic, and all instruction was still online (~3.5 semesters were fully online for my undergraduate career). This was a gentle introduction to teaching for me, and I loved it. I helped students learn about fundamental computer architecture and systems topics by answering questions in Zoom chat and assisting in laboratory office hours. Not only did this experience give me a taste of what teaching was like, it reinforced the concepts I had learned when I took the course myself in the previous semester! After this, I was inspired to keep teaching throughout my undergraduate career.
