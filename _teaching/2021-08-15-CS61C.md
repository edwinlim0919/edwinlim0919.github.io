This was my first semester working as a Course Tutor, and it was an interesting semester because not only was it a summer session, but it was still online due to the COVID-19 pandemic. I was also working as a Software Engineering Intern full-time at the same time, so it was a busy summer. But this was my first taste of leading a (small) class section myself, and I had a good time keeping myself busy!
