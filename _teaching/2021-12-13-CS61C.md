This was my first experience as a TA! I was so excited, because after working as an Academic Intern for CS 61C in the Spring and a Course Tutor for CS 61C in the Summer, I finally had the opportunity to work as an Undergraduate Student Instructor. However, as a first-time TA, sometimes I struggled to articulate the concepts I was teaching to the students in a good way, and there was a lot of trial and error. In the end, I got a lot better at communication concepts to others, and became a much more confident public speaker, which was definitely (and probably somewhat still is) one of my weaknesses. But knowing that this course was what made me fall in love with Computer Architecture, and that it could be the same for many of my students motivated me greatly.
