My second time teaching fun, personalized CS 61C tutoring sections!

---

This was my second time working as a Course Tutor for CS 61C, and it was fun! I led weekly tutoring sections and office hours in which I taught fundamental computer architecture and systems concepts through recitation slides and worksheets. The tutoring groups are small (~4 students), so I got to know the students in my section well, and lead sections that were more tailored towards their specific needs, which was nice.
