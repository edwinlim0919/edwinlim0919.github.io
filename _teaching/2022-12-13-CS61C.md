This was my second time TA'ing for this course, and I was much more comfortable/experienced in a teaching position than I was the first time. CS 61C is the last required prerequisite CS course for CS and EECS majors at UC Berkeley, and it dives below the layers of abstraction we had been exposed to in our previous CS courses. Students learn about systems programming, assembly language programming, digital design, CPU design, caches, virtual memory, and parallel programming. I greatly enjoyed this course when I took it (especially the CPU design project), and it inspired me to take other courses related to Computer Architecture in later semesters, shaping the direction of my undergraduate career.
