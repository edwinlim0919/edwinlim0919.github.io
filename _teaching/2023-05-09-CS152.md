I TA'd for one of my favorite courses at UC Berkeley! This is one of courses that first got me really interested in Computer Architecture and VLSI. I led various discussion sections and office hours to help students with concepts such as pipelining, memory hierarchy, out-of-order processors, branch prediction, multithreading, vector ISAs, cache coherence, memory consistency and synchronization. It was a fun part of a fulfilling last semester and Berkeley.
